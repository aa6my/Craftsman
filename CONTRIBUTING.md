## Contributing to Craftsman

An introduction to contributing to the Craftsman project.

---

The Craftsman project welcomes, and depends, on contributions from developers and users in the CodeIgniter open source community. Contributions can be made in a number of ways, a few examples are:

* Code patches via pull requests
* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports and patch reviews


## Reporting an Issue?

Please include as much detail as you can. Let us know your platform and Craftsman/CodeIgniter version. If the problem is visual (for example a theme or design issue) please add a screenshot and if you get an error please include the the full error and traceback.

<!-- ###Testing the Development Version

If you want to just install and try out the latest development version of Craftsman you can do so with composer: 

```
composer require "dsv/Craftsman":"dev-master"
```
This can be useful if you want to provide feedback for a new feature or want to confirm if a bug you have encountered is fixed in the git master. It is strongly recommended that you do this within a virtualenv. -->

<!--
Running the tests
To run the tests, it is recommended that you use Tox. This just needs to be pip installed and then the test suite can be ran for MkDocs but running the command tox in the root of your MkDocs repository.

It will attempt to run the tests against all of the Python versions we support. So don't be concerned if you are missing some and they fail. The rest will be verified by Travis when you submit a pull request.
-->

## Submitting Pull Requests

Once you are happy with your changes or you are ready for some feedback, push it to your fork and send a pull request. For a change to be accepted it will most likely need to have tests and documentation if it is a new feature.
