Installation
------------

**Optional**

Before run the composer install command, add the bin-dir config path inside your ```composer.json``` file:

{% highlight JSON %}
"config": {
    "bin-dir": "bin"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Also if you're going to use the [Migration Commands](#migrations) you should configure your `application/config/database.php` settings needed to access to your database.

**With Composer:**

	composer require dsv/craftsman

If you specify the bin directory you can run the command like this:

	php bin/craftsman

If you don't, this package should be listed as a vendor binary, and it should be runned like:

	php path/to/vendor/bin/craftsman

---

Getting started
---------------

To view a list of all available Craftsman commands, you may use the list command:

	php path/to/craftsman list

**Help Screen**

Every command includes a help screen which displays the command's available arguments and options. To view a help screen from a command, simply add the name of the command with help:

	php path/to/craftsman help migration:latest


---

Migrations
----------

Migration schemes are simple files that hold the commands to apply and remove changes to your database. It allows you to easily keep track of changes made in your app. They may create/modify tables or fields, etc. But they are not limited to just changing the schema. You could use them to fix bad data in the database or populate new fields.

## Migration file names

Each Migration is run in numeric order forward or backwards depending on the method taken. Two numbering styles are available:

* **Sequential**: each migration is numbered in sequence, starting with 001. Each number must be three digits, and there must not be any gaps in the sequence. (This was the numbering scheme prior to CodeIgniter 3.0.)
* **Timestamp**: each migration is numbered using the timestamp when the migration was created, in 'YYYYMMDDHHIISS' format (e.g. 20121031100537). This helps prevent numbering conflicts when working in a team environment, and is the preferred scheme in CodeIgniter 3.0 and later.

By default Craftsman uses the sequential style but it can be forced to change with the `--timestamp` argument used with every migration command listed bellow.

## Displaying info

You can display the current migration information with the comand:

	php path/to/craftsman migration:info

Output:

{% highlight Bash %}
 ---------------- --------------------------------------------------------------- 
  Migration        Value                                                          
 ---------------- --------------------------------------------------------------- 
  Name             ci_system                                                      
  Actual version   1                                                              
  File version     1                                                
  Path             /path/to/codeigniter/application/migrations/  
 ---------------- --------------------------------------------------------------- 

 [OK] Database is up-to-date.

{% endhighlight %}

Where:

* **Name**: migration name version.
* **Actual version**: version actually stored in your database.
* **File version**: latest migration file version founded in the migration directory.
* **Path** is the migration directory where all your migrations are stored.

Below the information table there is a legend witch indicates the action to take. If a database update is available, the legend displays the following message:

{% highlight Bash %}
 ---------------- --------------------------------------------------------------- 
  Migration        Value                                                          
 ---------------- --------------------------------------------------------------- 
  Name             ci_system                                                      
  Actual version   0                                                              
  File version     1                                                
  Path             /path/to/codeigniter/application/migrations/  
 ---------------- --------------------------------------------------------------- 

 ! [NOTE] The Database is not up-to-date with the latest changes, run:'migration:latest' to update them.

{% endhighlight %}


Each migration command shows relevant information to perform some action and it asks a Yes/No question to the user before perform some action.

## Running migrations

Migrations are designed to be mostly automatic, but youâ€™ll need to know when to make migrations, when to run them, and the common problems you might run into. Here's a list of possible options.

**Latest**

Migrate to the latest version, the migration class will use the very newest migration found in the filesystem.

	php path/to/craftsman migration:latest

**Version**

Version can be used to roll back changes or step forwards programmatically to specific versions.

	php path/to/craftsman migration:version <number>

## Rolling-back migrations

Allows you to quickly roll back and forth through the history of the migration schema, so as to work with desired version. Here's a list of possible options.

**Rollback the last migration operation**

	php path/to/craftsman migration:rollback

**Rollback all migrations**

	php path/to/craftsman migration:reset

**Rollback all migrations and run them all again**

	php path/to/craftsman migration:refresh

All migration versions of modules are stored apart from each other, so you can control the versions of every module and never interfering with each other.

Generators
----------

Craftsman provides a variety of generators to speed up your development process.

## Controller

Generate a controller with:

    php path/to/craftsman generator:controller <name>

Output:

{% highlight PHP startinline %}
<?php if ( ! defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed');

class Foo extends CI_Controller 
{

    /**
     * Display a listing of the resource.
     * GET /Foo
     */
    public function index()
    {
        
    }

    /**
     * Display the specified resource.
     * GET /Foo/get/{id}
     *
     * @param  int  $id
     */
    public function get($id)
    {

    }   

    /**
     * Show the form for creating a new resource.
     * GET /Foo/create
     */
    public function create()
    {

    }

    /**
     * Store a newly created resource in storage.
     * POST /Foo/store
     */ 
    public function store()
    {
        
    }

    /**
     * Show the form for editing the specified resource.
     * GET /Foo/edit/{id}
     *
     * @param  int  $id
     */
    public function edit($id)
    {

    }   

    /**
     * Update the specified resource in storage.
     * PUT /Foo/update/{id}
     *
     * @param  int  $id
     */
    public function update($id)
    {

    }

    /**
     * Remove the specified resource from storage.
     * DELETE /Foo/delete/{id}
     *
     * @param  int  $id
     */
    public function delete($id)
    {
        
    }
}

/* End of file Foo.php */
/* Location: /path/to/codeigniter/application/controllers/Foo.php */  
?> 
{% endhighlight %} 

You can put the controller inside a different directory with the `--path` argument. So, if you want to create the controller inside `new/path/admin`, you can do:

    php path/to/craftsman generator:controller foo --path='new/path/admin'

## Model

Generate a model with:

    php path/to/craftsman generator:model <name>

Output:

{% highlight PHP startinline %}
<?php if ( ! defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed');

class Foo_model extends CI_Model 
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
        $this->load->database();    
    }
}

/* End of file Foo_model.php */
/* Location: /path/to/codeigniter/application/models/Foo_model.php */
?>
{% endhighlight %}

Same as the [Controller Generator](#controller), you can put the model inside a different directory with the `--path` argument. So, if you want to create the model inside `new/path/admin`, you can do:

    php path/to/craftsman generator:controller foo --path='new/path/admin'

## Migration

Generate a migration with:

    php path/to/craftsman generator:migration <name>

Regardless of which numbering style you choose to use, the generator command will prefix your migration files with the migration number. For example:

* 001_add_blog.php (sequential numbering)
* 20121031100537_add_blog.php (timestamp numbering)    

If the migration name is prefixed by `create_` or `modify_` and is followed by a list of column names and types, then a migration containing the appropriate `add_column` and `update_column` statements will be created.

**Example**

    php path/to/craftsman generator:migration create_users firstname:varchar lastname:varchar email:varchar active:smallint

Output:

{% highlight PHP startinline %}
<?php if ( ! defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed');

class Migration_create_users extends CI_Migration {

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->load->dbforge();
        $this->load->database();
    }

    public function up() 
    {
        $this->create_users_table();
    }

    public function down() 
    {
        $this->dbforge->drop_table('ci_users');
    }

    private function create_users_table()
    {
        $this->dbforge->add_field(array(
            'id' => array(
                'type' => 'INT',
                'null' => FALSE,
                'auto_increment' => TRUE
            ),
            'firstname' => array(
                'type' => 'VARCHAR',
                'constraint' => 100,
                'null' => FALSE
            ),
            'lastname' => array(
                'type' => 'VARCHAR',
                'constraint' => 100,
                'null' => TRUE
            ),
            'email' => array(
                'type' => 'VARCHAR',
                'constraint' => 100,
                'null' => TRUE
            ),
            'active' => array(
                'type' => 'SMALLINT',
                'null' => FALSE,
                'default' => 1
            ),
        ));
        $this->dbforge->add_key('id', TRUE);
        $this->dbforge->create_table('ci_users',TRUE);      
    }
}

/* End of file 001_create_users.php.php */
/* Location: path/to/codeigniter/application/migrations/001_create_users.php */
?>
{% endhighlight %}

The migration file will be placed in your migration folder or any folder you specify with the `--path` argument instead of the default Codeigniter migration path with a version number as a prefix.

Now it's your turn to give the finishing touches before running this scheme. Check the [Database Forge documentation](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/database/forge.html) for more information about CodeIgniter Migrations.
